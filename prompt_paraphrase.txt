Given a record, your task is to generate a text based on the record.

The record is in the format below:

{"h": "", "r": "", "t": ""}

where h is the head entity, t is the tail entity, and r is the relation between the head and tail entities.

When you finished your answer, you should respond with "</s>". You should return only the output without the prompt.

I will provide you with an example below:

{"h": "Barack Obama", "r": "spouse", "t": "Michelle Obama"}

Barack Obama is the spouse of Michelle Obama.</s>
